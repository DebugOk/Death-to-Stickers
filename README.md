# Death-to-Stickers
###### Because fuck stickers


Please note that this code **__will not__** work with older versions of Discord.py

Currently you need the __latest GitHub version__, because of an issue that older versions have with stickers.

You can get it by running
`python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py`
